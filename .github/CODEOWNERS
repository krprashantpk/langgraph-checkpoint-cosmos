# CODEOWNERS file

# This file defines who is responsible for code review and approval

#

# Only krprashantpk can approve PRs for all branches

# To enforce this on develop and main branches, configure branch protection rules in GitHub:

# Settings > Branches > Branch protection rules > Require review from Code Owners

# All files in the repository require approval from krprashantpk
